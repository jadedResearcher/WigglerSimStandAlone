                                <h1>New Features</h1>
                                <li>2/4/18: Wiggler eyes are now stable. Wings might only show up post pupation, I don't even know.</li>
                                <li>1/29/18: thanks to FirankaMipi≈Ñska  for making a <a href="http://wigglersim.wikia.com/wiki/WigglerSim_Wiki">Wiki</a>!</li>
                                <li>1/28/18: Pagination for troll alumni works now. AND we have the <a href="viewSigns.html">Signs View</a> so you can check each kind of troll of your list-o-meter.</li>
                                <li>1/21/18: Particularly imaginative trolls might see imaginary friends when they are bored.</li>
                                <li>1/20/18: Mutant colored eyes and wing mutations for pupated trolls are now a thing.</li>
                                <li>1/17/18: KR gave me new animations for idle grubs. Unenergetic grubs will now wiggle around on their back.</li>
                                <li>Special thanks to Duckking for wiggler names. Empresses have a bit more complex effect on the sim, and wigglers remember those they have played with a bit.</li>
                                <li>1/13/18<h1>I am officially declaring Wiggler Sim in v1!!!</h1><br><br>
                                That means that the features it currently has constitute the base game, and, barring bug and balance fixes and maybe a few more items, it is 'complete'.
                                    <br><br>On weekends, while I'm mostly focusing on the NPCUpdate for <a href="http://www.farragofiction.com/SBURBSim">SBURBSim</a>, I will add things like achivements and filtering your alumni by aspect and caste. And I'm likely to add more gameplay features to bring it up to a full on v2 some day. </li>
                                <br><br>
                                <li>1/12/18: omfg, There is finally a currency system, which means the Item Shop has been rolled out.<br><br>There is even bug fixes and an actual fucking loading screen. <br><br>Oh shit, and the Empress Effects are done besides the items.
                                <br>
                                    Speaking of items, thanks goes to paranoiaInsomnia for making caste items like this: <img height="18" src="images/Items/jade.png"> and The Tormented contributed a SCIENCE TRIDENT.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li><br>
                                <li>1/11/18: Grubs don't use the worse looking crawling bodies as their default portraits anymore. <br><br>Working on shop shit. </li>
                                <li>1/10/18: Grubs can get bored of big dumb hug piles now and wander around occasionally.</li>
                                <li>1/9/18:  Simple, pointless playpen is available for you to shove your grubs into. Without any items to distract them it ends up turning into a giant grub pile p quickly. Oh well.<br><br> Next up is me getting a shop set up so you can buy items to shove in there and change your grub's stats.</li>
                                <li>12/31/17: The sim keeps track of who the current empress is, now.</li>
                                <li>12/29/17:  Mutant grubs have custom endings.<br><br> You can get the save data string for your grubs/alumni, so you can use them in other places. <br><br> Pupated trolls who refuse to leave the caverns are now kicked out at the next graduation. Also: You can click <a href="goodbye.html">Here</a> to kick them out manually.<br><br> Still working on playpen.</li>
                                <li>12/26/17: Been working on getting the playpen working (it's the biggest part of the planned features). In the meantime, finally enabled mutant blood trolls.</li>
                                <li>12/21/17: Pupated trolls are assigned a sign based on caste and highest aspect-stat, lunar sway is currently random.</li>
                                <li>12/20/17: Wigglers can die from things other than natural causes.</li>
                                <li>12/19/17: Wigglers have stats and the stats mildly effect the Epilogue with more effects planned.</li>
                                <br>
                                <h1>Known Bugs</h1>
                                <li>Renaming a wiggler right after it changes state (such as hatching) makes it revert to previous state. If you refresh, it's fixed.</li>
                                <li>Occasionally double clicking will give you twins of an egg. </li>
                                <br>

                                <h1>Expected Future Features: (for v2)</h1>

                                <li>random egg option (cheaper than other eggs, once currency)</li>
                                <li>pagination for adopts and alumni</li>
                                <li>stabilize save data. it corrupts sometimes. WHY???</li>

                                <li>Wiggler friendships. If two wigglers have a strong bond in the playpen diff interations, ((might be too hard, but, makes it into their epilogue in a tiny blurb???)) </li>
                                <li>vague genetics mechanic (big incestuous slurry (maybe you pick 10 alumni?) gets you a pile of traits (img layer values, palette color values, stats), new wiggler gets traits from all sources, with chance of mutation (including the highly visible ones like candy red). If all visible traits are from same troll, it's a descendant.
                                </li><li>Page where you can view grubs genetic source for each "gene" (only one layer deep though)</li>

                                <li>mini games with alumni</li>
                                <li> pointless dream like infinite walkaround game where you meet and talk to all your alumni (dif music in each 'room' determined by highest stat, all alumni have same highest stat?)</li>
